# 🧑‍💻 CS50AI — Project Archive

This repository collects my solutions for **Harvard’s CS50 Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence with Python** (“CS50AI”).  Each **branch** contains a
stand-alone project folder, mirroring the structure of the original course
assignments.

| Branch | Project | Topics |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `DegreesProject` | Degrees of Separation | BFS / heuristic search |
| `TictactoeProject` | Tic-Tac-Toe AI | Minimax & alpha-beta |
| `KnightsProject` | Knights Logic Puzzle | Model checking |
| `MinesweeperProject` | Knights Logic Puzzle | Model checking |
| `minesweeper` | Minesweeper AI             | Knowledge representation & inference |

> **How to view a project:**  
> 1. Switch to the branch (`git switch <branch>`).  
> 2. Follow the `README.md` inside that branch for setup and usage.

The default branch (`main`) contains only this high-level overview.
